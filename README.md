## RTAI 5.2.3 for LinuxCNC

IMPORTANT NOTICE: STOP COPYING MY WORK FROM THIS TREE WITHOUT CREDITING ME!

### Only AMD64 CPUs are supported!

Starting with IPIPE 4.14.71 from Xenomai, native 32-bit support has been disabled.
IA32 emulation and X32 ABI have been disabled due to build errors.

Currently, only LinuxCNC git branches `2.8` and `master` are fully compatible
with this tree. Andypugh has fixed all issues in LinuxCNC mainline, so big
shoutout to him! The first stable LinuxCNC 2.8 release will have all the required
fixes included, but for now you must use LinuxCNC git sources.
