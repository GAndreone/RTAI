## RTAI 5.2.3 for LinuxCNC

IMPORTANT NOTICE: STOP COPYING MY WORK FROM THIS TREE WITHOUT CREDITING ME!

### Only AMD64 CPUs are supported!

Starting with IPIPE 4.14.71 from Xenomai, native 32-bit support has been disabled.
This is unlikely to change in the future, but 32-bit support will remain in RTAI for the time being.
IA32 emulation and X32 ABI has been disabled due to build errors.
